        <p>In middle and high school, I was an avid (2D) digital artist. It was through art and art-sharing sites that I dicovered the graphics of Final Fantasy XIII. Since then I had wanted to work for Square Enix on the Final Fantasy series, particularly on their graphics end. However, I was afraid of failure in the graphics industry, so when I came to NYU I chose to study Computer Science in its stead. There are many ways graphics and programming convene and every game company needs programmers. You can have a great game with poor art but the depth of your game can only go so far if you have poor programming, even if the graphics are top-notch. That being said, I did not give up on my dream. I was on track to minor in Game Design - I have experience making games in Unity and 3D modelling in Maya - but unfortunately the requirements have since changed and I no longer can graduate on time.</p>

        <p>From this course, I hope to supplement what I have learned from my game design courses. In addition, I want to learn how I can easily display 3D graphics on the web. When I first learned Unity, sharing my projects was not that simple. I hosted my projects via Google Drive but the results were not consistent. I want to be able to easily show my work, with the same ease as I do showing samples of my web design or my artwork. I also have no knowledge in the space of virtual reality, a mishap I would like to fix. Though we have been trying for years and years to bring virtual reality and have met with various failures, virtual reality seems to be the natural direction in gaming and programming, given the more and more realistic trends in video game graphics.</p>

        <p>The course for Unity I took was a summer session: terribly brief and lacking in depth. Unity is a wonderful program, but like Apple's Xcode, it is so easy to use Unity to produce wonderful things but never understand what is really happening under the hood. I feel that is where I am. I have used raycasting; it was my lifesaver and probably my favourite part about programming with Unity. But I have little understanding of how it works. As previously stated, I want to learn about virtual reality and I want to know how I can create works that can be shared more fluidly than Unity projects. Lastly, I want to know how the shapes we see are rendered on the browser.</p>
