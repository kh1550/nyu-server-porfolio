		<p>The world is not always as civilized as people might think. There are still those who would follow the blackest 
		paths of magic and become corrupted by the darker powers that flow through Runeterra. Shauna Vayne knows this fact
		well. As a young privileged girl in the heart of Demacia's elite, her father tried to convince her of the constabulary's
		ever-vigilant eye. Young and naive, she truly believed that her world was one of perfect safety, until one night, when
		a twisted witch took interest in her father. The malevolent woman overcame her father's conciliar guard, then tortured
		her family before murdering them. The young Shauna escaped only by hiding herself and then fleeing once the hag had 
		departed, plagued by the screams of her loved ones as she ran. A burning hatred was born in her that day, one that 
		could never be denied.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>Vayne was able to take care of herself using her father's money, and she began to train as soon as an instructor 
		would have her as a student. By the time she was a fully grown woman, she had become a grim warrior. However, the 
		fields of battle were not to be her home. Demacia needed a protector, one who hunted those lost to the darkness. 
		Shauna used her family's contacts to become the first Night Hunter, and now her prowess is the stuff of legends. It 
		is said that those who practice the black arts quake when they hear that the Night Hunter is on the prowl. Despite 
		her crusade, Shauna has looked at the League of Legends in horror. There are champions who have clearly lost themselves 
		to the blackest of magics, and who have been embraced within the League even though they should be put down for the 
		safety of all. The time has come for the Night Hunter to execute her secret mission - to purge the League of Legends.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
		<p>Not all shadows are to be feared. At least, if Vayne has her way.</p>
