	<h3>GLaDOS</h3>
	<p class="italic">Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System</p>
	<br>
	<p class="left">GLaDOS is an artificial intelligence created by Aperture
Laboratories and remains one of our greatest successes. She is
the overseer of our celebrated <a href="contact.html">Aperture Science Enrichment
Center</a> and cares for the well-being of our testing volunteers.
As the most advanced aritificial intelligence in our age, the
well-being of your friends and family are GLaDOS's number
one priority.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="left">GLaDOS v1.10 is currently responsible for handling <a href="contact.html">Aperture
Science's Enrichment Center Test Subject Application Process</a>,
while GLaDOS v3.11 oversees our vigorous testing and research
processes.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="left">GLaDOS's first iteration was constructed in 1986 with the intention of accelerating <a href="projects.html">the Portal project</a>. A prototype chassis for
GLaDOS was constructed in 1989, but is currently not in use. In 1996, after a decade spent bringing the Disk Operating System
parts to a state of more or less basic functionality, work began on the Genetic Lifeform component.
CEO Cave Johnson originally intended to be the computer's Genetic Lifeform component. However, Johnson ultimately died
before his consciousness could be uploaded into the system. He left instructions that his assistant Caroline should be fitted as
the Genetic Lifeform component so that she would be able to run Aperture Laboratories in perpetuity after his death. Her consciousness
remains to be the driving Genetic Lifeform component of the latest version of GLaDOS.
Due to GLaDOS v3.11's wild success, Aperture Laboratories has been ridiculed with bogus, fantastic claims, particulary aimed
at GLaDOS. These false claims are currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with Black Mesa as the
prime suspect for slander. Any rumours that GLaDOS attempted to kill Aperture Laboratories employees within "one sixteenth
of a picosecond" and that GLaDOS released a deadly neuro-toxin on Aperture Laboratories's first ever bring-your-daughterto-
work day after separate activations are outrageous and completely false. As a preventative measure only, our latest improvements
on GLaDOS aim to alter GLaDOS' personality and curb her unfriendly tendencies by adding various Personality Cores
to her system. These personality cores operate individually as well. One such personality core, called Wheatley, manages the
personal well-being of testing volunteers to ensure safety and security for all.</p>
