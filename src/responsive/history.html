	<p>In 1947, Aperture Fixtures was founded by Cave Johnson as a shower curtain manufacturer (The
name Aperture Fixtures was chosen "to make the curtains appear more hygienic"). In 1956, the
Eisenhower administration signed a contract with Aperture to manufacture shower curtains to all
branches of the US Military, except the Navy. From 1957 to 1973, the company produced mostly
shower curtains and enjoyed a great deal of success, making Cave Johnson a billionaire. Until
1973, Aperture also used a bulletin board system.</p>
	<br>
	<p>During this time, early work on the <a href="projects.html">Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device</a> began; the early version,
called the Aperture Science Portable Quantum Tunneling Device, proved to be too bulky for
effective use, while poor surface conductors for the portals often caused mangling or death of the
test subjects when they tried to use the portals. Repulsion Gel was first developed around this time
as well for use as a diet suppliment. At first only the brightest and best of society were chosen for
testing, but after being connected to a string of astronaut disappearances in 1968, Aperture Science
focused on recruiting homeless people for testing, starting in 1976. Cave suspects Black Mesa of
industrial espionage on the company's products, and blames them for Aperture's bankruptcy.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In 1974, Cave Johnson was exposed to toxic Conversion Gel, made out of ground-up moon rocks.
In 1976, both of Cave Johnson’s kidneys failed. Brain damaged, dying, and incapable of realizing
time was not now flowing backwards, he laid out a three-tiered research and development program.
The results, he said, will "guarantee the continued success of Aperture Science far into the
fast-approaching distant past."</p>
	<br>
	<p>The three tiers of this research and development program are:</p>
	<br>
	<ul class="list">
	  <li>Tier 1: <a href="projects.html">The Counter-Heimlich Maneuver</a></li>
	  <li>Tier 2: <a href="projects.html">The Take-a-Wish Foundation</a></li>
	  <li>Tier 3: <a href="projects.html">The Portal Project</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Following Cave Johnson's death, in 1981, Aperture engineers complete the Heimlich Counter-Maneuver
and Take-A-Wish Foundation initiatives. After hearing the progress on Tier 3, Aperture
Labs was granted an open-ended contract to secretly continue research on the "Portal" and Heimlich
Counter-Maneuver projects.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In 1986, word reached Aperture Science management that rival Black Mesa was working on a similar
portal technology. In response to this news, Aperture Science begins developing <a href="glados.html">GLaDOS</a>. In
1996, after a decade spent bringing the Disk Operating System parts of <a href="glados.html">GLaDOS</a> to a state of more
or less basic functionality, work began on the Genetic Lifeform component. Work on <a href="glados.html">GLaDOS</a> is
still underway in pursuit of our founder's dream.</p>
